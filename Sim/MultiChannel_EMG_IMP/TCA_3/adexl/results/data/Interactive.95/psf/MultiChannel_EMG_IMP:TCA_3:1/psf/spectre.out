Opening the PSF file ../psf/dcOp.dc ...
Important parameter values:

Notice from spectre during DC analysis `dcOp'.
    Bad pivoting is found during DC analysis. Option dc_pivot_check=yes is recommended for possible improvement of convergence.


Maximum value achieved for any signal of each quantity: 
V: V(VDDA) = 1.8 V
I: I(V4:p) = 15.37 uA
Convergence achieved in 18 iterations.

Notice from spectre during DC analysis `dcOp'.
    Bad pivoting is found during DC analysis. Option dc_pivot_check=yes is recommended for possible improvement of convergence.


Maximum value achieved for any signal of each quantity: 
V: V(VDDA) = 1.8 V
I: I(V4:p) = 15.36 uA
Convergence achieved in 20 iterations.
