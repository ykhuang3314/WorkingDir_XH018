WARNING (OSSHNL-269): Variable 'simModelNamePrefix' is not defined in the
current netlisting session. It had a value
'_unl' last time netlisting was done
in current run directory. Netlists from last
session cannot be used for
incremental netlisting. Therefore re-netlisting the
design.

ERROR (OSSHNL-116): Unable to descend into any of the views defined in the view
list, 'spectre veriloga ahdl cmos_sch schematic', for the

library
'MultiChannel_EMG_Model', or modify the view list so that it contains an
existing view.
