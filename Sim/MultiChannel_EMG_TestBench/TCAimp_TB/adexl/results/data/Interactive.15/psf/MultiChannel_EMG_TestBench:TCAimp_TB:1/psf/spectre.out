********************************************
AC Analysis `ac': freq = (10 mHz -> 100 MHz)
********************************************

Notice from spectre during DC analysis, during AC analysis `ac'.
    Bad pivoting is found during DC analysis. Option dc_pivot_check=yes is recommended for possible improvement of convergence.

DC simulation time: CPU = 3.147 ms, elapsed = 3.14808 ms.
