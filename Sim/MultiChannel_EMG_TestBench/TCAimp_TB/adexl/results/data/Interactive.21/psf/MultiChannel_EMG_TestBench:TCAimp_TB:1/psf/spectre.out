Maximum value achieved for any signal of each quantity:

If your circuit contains signals of the same quantity that are vastly different in size (such as high voltage circuitry combined with low voltage control circuitry), you should consider specifying global option `bin_relref=yes'.

Maximum value achieved for any signal of each quantity: 
V: V(net020) = 1.8 V
I: I(V4:p) = 17.3 uA
If your circuit contains signals of the same quantity that are vastly different in size (such as high voltage circuitry combined with low voltage control circuitry), you should consider specifying global option `bin_relref=yes'.

Notice from spectre during DC analysis `dcOp'.
    Bad pivoting is found during DC analysis. Option dc_pivot_check=yes is recommended for possible improvement of convergence.

If your circuit contains signals of the same quantity that are vastly different in size (such as high voltage circuitry combined with low voltage control circuitry), you should consider specifying global option `bin_relref=yes'.

If your circuit contains signals of the same quantity that are vastly different in size (such as high voltage circuitry combined with low voltage control circuitry), you should consider specifying global option `bin_relref=yes'.

If your circuit contains signals of the same quantity that are vastly different in size (such as high voltage circuitry combined with low voltage control circuitry), you should consider specifying global option `bin_relref=yes'.

If your circuit contains signals of the same quantity that are vastly different in size (such as high voltage circuitry combined with low voltage control circuitry), you should consider specifying global option `bin_relref=yes'.

Maximum value achieved for any signal of each quantity: 
V: V(net020) = 1.8 V
I: I(V4:p) = 17.39 uA
If your circuit contains signals of the same quantity that are vastly different in size (such as high voltage circuitry combined with low voltage control circuitry), you should consider specifying global option `bin_relref=yes'.

Notice from spectre during DC analysis `dcOp'.
    Bad pivoting is found during DC analysis. Option dc_pivot_check=yes is recommended for possible improvement of convergence.


Maximum value achieved for any signal of each quantity: 
V: V(net020) = 1.8 V
I: I(V4:p) = 17.39 uA
Convergence achieved in 14 iterations.

If your circuit contains signals of the same quantity that are vastly different in size (such as high voltage circuitry combined with low voltage control circuitry), you should consider specifying global option `bin_relref=yes'.

AC Analysis `ac': freq = (10 mHz -> 100 MHz)
********************************************

Notice from spectre during DC analysis, during AC analysis `ac'.
    Bad pivoting is found during DC analysis. Option dc_pivot_check=yes is recommended for possible improvement of convergence.

DC simulation time: CPU = 2.967 ms, elapsed = 2.96807 ms.

If your circuit contains signals of the same quantity that are vastly different in size (such as high voltage circuitry combined with low voltage control circuitry), you should consider specifying global option `bin_relref=yes'.

   -   Non-default settings that could significantly slow down simulation
          errpreset = conservative_sigglobal, default moderate
          reltol = 10e-06, default 100e-06 (conservative)
   -   Features that may significantly slowing down simulation
          iprobe = 12.12 % of total equations

During simulation, the CPU load for active processors is :
        Spectre  0 (4.0 %)       1 (13.7 %)      2 (21.6 %)     23 (82.7 %)
        Other    8 (2.0 %)      14 (2.0 %)      26 (6.1 %)      
Initial condition solution time: CPU = 893 us, elapsed = 905.037 us.
Intrinsic tran analysis time:    CPU = 22.733 ms, elapsed = 24.986 ms.
Total time required for tran analysis `tran': CPU = 26.332 ms, elapsed = 28.5819 ms.

Notice from spectre during DC analysis `dcOp'.
    Bad pivoting is found during DC analysis. Option dc_pivot_check=yes is recommended for possible improvement of convergence.

Maximum value achieved for any signal of each quantity:

If your circuit contains signals of the same quantity that are vastly different in size (such as high voltage circuitry combined with low voltage control circuitry), you should consider specifying global option `bin_relref=yes'.

If your circuit contains signals of the same quantity that are vastly different in size (such as high voltage circuitry combined with low voltage control circuitry), you should consider specifying global option `bin_relref=yes'.

Maximum value achieved for any signal of each quantity: 
V: V(net020) = 1.8 V
I: I(V4:p) = 17.39 uA
If your circuit contains signals of the same quantity that are vastly different in size (such as high voltage circuitry combined with low voltage control circuitry), you should consider specifying global option `bin_relref=yes'.

Notice from spectre during DC analysis `dcOp'.
    Bad pivoting is found during DC analysis. Option dc_pivot_check=yes is recommended for possible improvement of convergence.
